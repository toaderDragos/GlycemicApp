Introduction
------------

This app is an stater code for an Inventory/ glycemic tracking app. The app is a work in progress and should populate some fields by user input and
other fields by calculation. It is an app that calculates the glycemic index of the foods you eat. That is why I chose to modify the Inventory App in such a way that it calculates the glycemic index instead, gaining speed and efficiency.

This app demonstrated the use of Android Jetpack component [Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) database.
The app also leverages [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel),
[LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata),
[Flow](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow),
[View Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding),
and [Navigation](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/navigation/)
with the SafeArgs plugin for parameter passing between fragments.
